# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to investigate contributing.

Here are some guidelines to follow...

- Please open an issue before submitting any pull requests, to avoid duplication
  of efforts, and to ensure you don't spend your time with something that may
  not ever be merged. It also helps us keep track of things over time.

- Use `npm run commit` instead of `git commit` - ensures we get high quality
  commit messages in a very easy way
